ABSTRACT={Infection by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii can have a devastating impact on the structure and function of the brain of the infected individuals, particularly immunocompromised patients. A systems biology view of the brain transcriptome can identify key molecular targets and pathways that mediate the neuropathogenesis of cerebral toxoplasmosis. Here, we performed transcriptomic analysis of the brain of mice infected by T. gondii Pru strain oocysts at 11 and 33 days post-infection (dpi) compared to uninfected (control) mice using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). T. gondii altered the expression of 936 and 2,081 transcripts at 11 and 33 dpi, respectively, and most of these were upregulated in the infected brains. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and pathway analysis showed that immune response, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) responsive genes were strongly affected at 11dpi. Likewise, differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) related to T cell activation, cytokine production and immune cell proliferation were significantly altered at 33 dpi. Host-parasite interactome analysis showed that some DETs were involved in immune signaling, metabolism, biosynthesis-related processes and interspecies interaction. These findings should increase knowledge of the mouse brain transcriptome and the changes in transcriptional regulation and downstream signaling pathways during acute and chronic T. gondii infections.}
